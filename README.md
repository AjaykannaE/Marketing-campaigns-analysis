# Marketing Campaigns Analysis — Data Science Project
An end-to-end Data Science project focused on understanding 
customer behavior and campaign performance using EDA and 
statistical hypothesis testing.

---

## Problem Statement
To identify the key factors influencing customer acquisition 
and spending behavior across products, channels, and markets 
through exploratory analysis and hypothesis testing.

---

## Project Workflow
- Data Cleaning & Quality Checks
- Missing Value Imputation (Group Median Strategy)
- Feature Engineering (Age, Total Spending, Total Purchases)
- Outlier Treatment using IQR Capping
- Categorical Encoding (Ordinal & One-Hot)
- Correlation Analysis & Heatmap
- Hypothesis Testing:
  - Older customers and in-store shopping preference
  - Parental status and online shopping behavior
  - Channel cannibalization across web, catalog, and store
  - USA vs rest of world in total purchase volumes
- Business Insight Visualizations

---

## Statistical Tests Used
- **Pearson Correlation** — relationship between numeric variables
- **Welch's T-Test** — comparison between two independent groups
- **Point-Biserial Correlation** — numeric vs binary variable relationship
